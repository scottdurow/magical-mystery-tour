   ![Who](./assets/who.png)
   
   ## ✅Deploy Azure Resources
   
   The Contoso Real Estate (Power Platform Edition) project utilizes several Azure components to enable its functionality. These components include:
   
   1. **Payments API Azure Functions** - This component is used to host the payments api that is used by:
      - **Power Platform Custom Connector** to create a Stripe Checkout session that is called by the portal using a Power Automate Flow. This is used for listing reservations.
      - **Power Platform Custom Connector** to list Payments
      - **Dataverse Virtual Table Provider** C# Plugin to expose the Payments as a Dataverse Virtual Table
      - **Webhook** that is called by Stripe when payments events are raised
   2. **Azure SQL Database** - Stores the payments made via Stripe
   3. **Azure Key Vault** - Used to store all secrets that are necessary and is configured as the backing for Power Platform Environment Variable secrets.
       - `AZURE-SQL-CONNECTION-STRING-payments-api` - SQL connection string for the Payments database. This does not contain any login username or password because the Azure Function uses a Managed Identity to connect to the database. E.g. `Server=tcp:sql-***.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=contoso-real-estate;`. [Learn about Managed Identities in Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts)
       - `cre-..-development-payments-api-client-secret`- Custom Connector Client Secret that is referenced by the Power Platform Environment Variable Secret and used in the custom connectors.
       - `StripeApiKey` - The Stripe API key to use for payment processing
       - `StripeWebhookSecret` - The Stripe webhook secret to use for verifying webhook events
   4. **Entra ID Application registrations** used to authenticate Power Platform against the Payments API
   
   ### 🦾Deploying Azure Resources
   
   To deploy the Azure resources required for the Contoso Real Estate (Power Platform Edition) project, you can use the `azd up` command. This command is part of the Azure DevOps CLI extension and allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code.
   
   Here are the steps to deploy the Azure resources using `azd up`:
   
1. Open a PowerShell terminal window inside VSCode at the root of the cloned repo.

1. Ensure the Azure CLI by following the instructions provided in the [official Azure CLI documentation for your operating system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can check the installation using at the VSCode powershell terminal:

    ```powershell
    az version
    ```

1. Log in to your Azure account by running the following command and following the prompts:

    ```powershell
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

    Copy the code shown, open the browser profile window you created, and navigate to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin.

    Enter the code and select Next. Select your login and select **Continue**. Close the browser window once you have signed in.
   
 > [!NOTE]
 > If you have multiple tenants, you may need to also provide the --tenant parameter. 
   
3. After successfully logging in, select the subscription you would like to deploy into.

    If you have previously logged in, you can view the subscriptions and select one using:

    ```powershell
    az account list --output table
    az account set --subscription <Subscription Id you wish to use>
    ```

1. You must be a member of the **User Access Administrator** and **Key Vault Administrator** on your subscription to manage the access control on a key vault.

    ```powershell
    # Set the subscription and user principal name
    $subscriptionId = az account show --query id --output tsv
    $currentUPN = az ad signed-in-user show --query userPrincipalName
    
    # Find the roles of the current user for the currently selected subscription
    az role assignment list --query "[?principalName=='$currentUPN' && scope=='/subscriptions/$subscriptionId'].roleDefinitionName" --output table
    ```

    If you do not see the two roles `Key Vault Administrator` and `User Access Administrator`, then use the following:

    ```powershell
    # Assign the "Key Vault Administrator" and "User Access Administrator" role to the user
    az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Administrator" --assignee $currentUPN --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    az role assignment create --role "User Access Administrator" --assignee $currentUPN --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Secrets User" --assignee $currentUPN --scope /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
    ```

1. The Power Platform Resource Provider must be registered in your Azure subscription so that Dataverse can access Azure Key Vaults in that subscription. At the VSCode PowerShell terminal, use:

    ```powershell
    az provider register -n Microsoft.PowerPlatform
    az provider show -n Microsoft.PowerPlatform --query "registrationState"
    ```

    Registration will take a few minutes.

1. Ensure your terminal has the repo root as the current directory.

1. Install the Azure DevOps CLI extension by running the following command:

    ```powershell
    infra\azd\install-azd.ps1
    ```
      
 > [!NOTE]
 > You must close and re-open all instances of VSCode. Use `azd version` at the VSCode terminal to ensure you have `azd` installed.
      
8. Install bicep using:

    ```powershell
    az bicep install
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Check you have the latest version of Bicep (>= 0.29.47) installed using `az bicep version`. Bicep is located in your azd bin folder `%USERPROFILE%\.azd\bin`

9. Run the `azd up` command to start the deployment process:

    ```powershell
    az extension add --name graphservices
    azd up --environment development
    ```

    The `environment` parameter would normally be the Power Platform environment that is being deployed to e.g. `elaiza-dev1` `UAT` `PROD`

1. When asked if you want to create the Environment, press 'Y'.

1. Select the Subscription to use when prompted.

1. Select the location to use - e.g. Central US
      
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When selecting a Azure location to deploy into, avoid using **WEST US 2** due to there often being resource capacity limitations.
   
13. When prompted for the 'principalLoginName' infrastructure parameter, enter your Power Platform username e.g. `some.user@myenvironment.omicrosoft.com`. This will be stored in a file called `.azure/<environmentname>/config.json`. It is important to ensure that this user name is the one you have authenticated against Azure with. It will be used to set the administrator of the SQL Server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to deploy updates to the code later on after the infrastructure has been published you can use `azd deploy`

14. Monitor the deployment progress and check for any errors or warnings. The `azd up` command will provide detailed logs and feedback during the deployment process.
      
> [!NOTE]
> You may need to run `azd up` a second time if there are errors the first time (due to azure replication)
      
![azd up](./assets/azd-up.png)
   

## 📜Post deployment steps

Some settings cannot be performed by Bicep/ARM scripts (or are complex and beyond the scope of this sample). To complete the deployment the following tasks must be carried out:

- Grant the Azure Function Payment API managed identity access to SQL Server. The Azure Functions run under a System Assigned Managed Identity (SAMI). This identity must be added to the SQL Server as an external user. This cannot be performed by a SQL Login (inside the bicep script), because it needs access to Entra ID.
- Add admin consent to the Payment API client Entra ID Application registration, so that it can be used as an SPN connection in Power Platform
- Grant your user access to the Payment API so that it can be used as an OAuth user connection in Power Platform for testing.

To perform the post deployment:

1. You will need a stripe account for the payment API to function. You do not need a production account, a developer test account is created for free.
1. Navigate to [Sign Up and Create a Stripe Account | Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
1. Enter you Email, Name, Country, and Password. 
1. Select **Create account**.
1. Validate your email address by following the instructions.
1. Navigate to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard

7. Run the following and follow the instructions carefully:

```powershell
./infra/scripts/post-deployment-setup.ps1
```

Enter the environment that you deployed using azd. If you have deployed multiple times with different names, then you must pick the one you are setting up.

## ✅Deploying Core Development Solution

The Core development environment has the custom controls solution deployed as managed, and the Core solution deployed as unmanaged to enable it to be worked on.

1. Using the Power Platform Developer Tools in VSCode, select the environment you wish to deploy to. You can see which environment you currently have selected by using:

   ```powershell
   pac env who
   ```

1. Inside **VSCode**, drag the script located at `src\core\solution\deployment-scripts\1-deploy-to-development-environment.ps1` into the PowerShell terminal window, and press **Enter** to execute it

1. Follow the instructions when running the script carefully. You will need to select the Azure environment that you deployed using azd up, then download the `ContosoRealEstateCustomControls_managed.zip` solution into the `temp_releases` folder using the path given.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you receive the error `SignTool.exe not found`, then ensure you selected the `Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)` additional install when installing **Visual Studio**.

## ✅Core Post Deployment Steps

There are some manual tasks that cannot be performed during solution deployment after you have run the `azure-api` installation procedure and deployed to your development environment:

- Reply URLs added to the Payments API Entra ID application registration to match the custom connectors
- Update the Plugin Managed Identity to match your azure deployment

Run the following PowerShell and follow the instructions carefully:

1. Drag the script located at `src\core\solution\deployment-scripts\2-post-deployment-setup.ps1` into your VSCode terminal window and press **Enter**.
1. You will be prompted to open the 2 custom connectors and copy the Reply Urls so that they can be added to the Entra ID application.
1. You will be asked if you would like to update the managed identity settings. This will configure the virtual entity plugin to connect to the Azure API.

## ✅Deploying the Portal Development Solution

The source for the Portal solution is built using:

- Power Pages
- Power Apps Component Framework
- Copilot Studio

When working on this solution, it must be deployed to a separate environment that has the CustomControls and Core solutions installed as a managed solution.

The following tasks must be carried out before you import that `ContosoRealEstatePortal` solution

### 🤖Turn off Automatic Copilot Creation for Power Pages

When a power pages site is created, by default a new Copilot will be created and the `SiteComponent` with type `BotConsumer` will be updated to point to the new copilot. This interferes with the CI/CD process. As a work around the the `enableChatbotOnWebsiteCreation` Tenant setting should be turned off using the Power Platform admin PowerShell:

```powershell
# Install the Power Platform PowerShell Admin commands
# See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powershell-installation
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell

# Authenticate
Add-PowerAppsAccount -Endpoint prod

# Update tenant settings
$requestBody = @{
        powerPlatform = @{
            powerPages = @{
                enableChatbotOnWebsiteCreation = $false
            } 
        } 
    }

Set-TenantSettings -RequestBody $requestBody
```

For more information, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/getting-started/enable-chatbot

### 👉Deploy to Portal Developer Environment

To deploy the Portal solution, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure you have all the updates installed via the Dynamics 365 apps page in the [admin portal](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) for your CRE Portal Dev environment.

1. Inside VS Code, change the selected environment to be your CRE Portal Dev environment by electing the  environment in the Power Platform Developer Tools, or by using `pac env list` and `pac env select -env "CRE Portal Dev (yourname)"`

1. Drag into the terminal the script at `src\portal\solution\deployment-scripts\deploy-to-development-environment.ps1`, press Enter, and follow the instructions carefully.

1. You will be prompted to download the Custom Controls and Core **managed** solutions from the repo and place into the temp_release folder location given.

1. The Portal solution will be built locally

1. The **managed** solutions are first installed, and then the portal **unmanaged** solution is imported.

## ✅Core Post Deployment Set up

To perform post deployment steps, first drag the Core solution post deployment setup script into the VSCode terminal and press Enter.

```powershell
src\core\solution\deployment-scripts\2-post-deployment-setup.ps1
```

This will:

- Reply URLs added to the Payments API Entra ID application registration to match the custom connectors
- Update the Plugin Managed Identity to match your azure deployment

### 🔌Create connections

The portal solution uses a couple of connections. When importing the solution manually you will be prompted to wire up the different connection references to an actual connection, but when using the deployment script you will need to create them after deployment. The CI/CD pipeline automatically associates the connection references to connections using the deploymentSettings.json

Note: You will need to have run the post deployment steps for the core solution to setup the reply urls for the connectors.

This can be done automatically in the CI/CD deployment pipeline using the `deploymentSettings.json` but is easiest done manually when working on your development environment.

- `Dataverse` - Connection used by Cloud Flows and Copilot Studio
- `Contoso Stripe API` - Connection for Portal Cloud Flows

1. Open make.powerapps.com and open the `Contoso Real Estate Portal` solution
1. Open **Connection References**

## ✅ Testing the API Azure Function locally

You can run the unit tests on the Azure functions Payments API by performing the following steps:

1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio** at `contoso-real-estate-power\src\azure-api\Contoso.API.Payments.sln`

1. If you see the message 'This project is targeting a version of .NET which is not installed', select **Install**, and then re-open Visual Studio when complete.

1. Open the Test Explorer using **Test**-> **Test Explorer**.

1. The tests are integration tests and so require a direct connection to the deployed Azure Resources.

1. Inside your azure portal, navigate to your resource control deployed, and select the **Key Vault**.

1. Navigate to **Secrets**, and copy the value for the  `AZURE-SQL-CONNECTION-STRING-payments-api`. Selecting the **clip board icon** will copy the value to your clip board.

1. Right click on the `Contoso.API.Payments` project and select **Manage User Secrets**.

1. Add the following keys:
   ```
     "AZURE-SQL-CONNECTION-STRING-payments-api": "<PASTE THE VALUE OF ThE SECRET AZURE-SQL-CONNECTION-STRING-payments-api>",
     "StripeApiKey": "<PASTE THE VALUE OF THE SECRET StripeApiKey>"
   ```

1. Repeat for the `StripeApiKey` secret

1. **Save** and close **the** secrets file.

1. The Integration tests use the identity you are logged into the Azure CLI using, so ensure that the account used with az login has access to the Azure resources (e.g. the user that you used to deploy with).

1. You can now run the integration tests

1. If you Start the Azure Functions, they will also host the endpoints on localhost so you can debug and develop locally.

## ✅ Testing the Virtual Table Provider locally

The C# Plugin Virtual Table Provider calls the Azure Functions API using the Dataverse Managed Identity. In order to run this using a local integration test, you must setup the secrets to give a connection to the API

1. Load the Payments Virtual Table Provider solution from `src\core\plugins\payments-virtual-table-provider\PaymentVirtualTableProvider.sln`

1. cd In order to run the integration tests, you will need to add secrets to connect to the Azure Functions API.
   The secrets should never be added to this repo and are stored in your user `appdata` folder.

   The `MicrosoftConfigurationBuilders.UserSecrets.UserSecretsConfigurationBuilder` NuGet package is used to read the secrets from the user secrets store.

   You can create the secrets file using the following PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   ./src/core/plugins/payments-virtual-table-provider/PaymentVirtualTableProvider.Tests/set-integration-test-secrets.ps1
   ```

   The easiest way to do this from **Visual Studio** is right click on the script and select Open in PowerShell ISE, then select **Run Script**.

1. When prompted, enter the following - using the value from your azure `.env` file.

   1. Tenant Id for your Azure subscription - `AZURE_TENANT_ID` in your .env file
   1. Payments Client Application Id - `ENTRA_API_CLIENT_APP_ID` in your `.env` file
   1. Secret for the Payment Client - Inside **Entra ID** -> **App Registrations** -> All applications, find the application using the ID you provided. It will be called `Client for Contoso Real Estate Payments API (your deployment name)`. Open it, and under Certificates & secrets, select **+ New client secret**. Give a name similar to 'Integration Tests', Add and then **Copy** the Value.
   1. Resource Url for the payments client - api://`ENTRA_API_APP_ID`
   1. Scope for the payments client: api://`ENTRA_API_APP_ID`/user_impersonation
   1. Host for the payments API - `SERVICE_API_URI` in your `.env` file (without the https://)
   1. Base URL for the payments - set to `api/`
   1. Integration testing string - `AuthType=OAuth; Username=<User Name>; Url=<Environment Url>; AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d; RedirectUri=app://58145B91-0C36-4500-8554-080854F2AC97; LoginPrompt=Auto`

1. You can now run the integration tests and they will connect to your Azure resources.
